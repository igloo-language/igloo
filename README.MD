<p align = 'center'><b>Igloo is a high level syntax oriented programming language in which you can change the syntax of the language within itself.</b></p>

<br>

<p align = 'center'>Currently, Igloo only has a (slow) implementation in Python 3.8, but in the future, may have a (faster) implementation in Rust.</p>

# An Example

```igloo
func return_five() {
  5 // or `return 5;`
}
x = return_five();
// `x` now has the value of `5`
```

# Getting Started

To use Igloo, download this repository locally. E.g:

```bash
$ cd igloo # go into igloo repository folder
$ python3.8 igloo/ igloo_file.ig # filename
```

# Compiled Releases

*Compiled releases are coming soon.*
